# clock-driven-scheduler
This repository contains the final project for the course "Real Time Operating Systems" of the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering.

The software contained is written in C++, and it simulates the behaviour of a clock driven scheduler.
See the related [PDF document](https://github.com/francescovetere/clock-driven-scheduler/edit/master/clock-driven-scheduler.pdf) to fully understand how it works.

# Usage
```
$ cd src
$ make
$ sudo ./application-ok
```
